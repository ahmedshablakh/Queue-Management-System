# Queue Management System - C++

## Project Description
A C++ program designed to manage queues in governmental institutions and centers that require organized waiting processes. The system prints a ticket containing:
- **Ticket Number**: Unique identifier for the ticket.
- **Date and Time**: The moment when the ticket is issued.
- **Estimated Waiting Time**: Expected waiting duration.
- **Number of People Ahead**: Number of individuals in front of the user in the queue.

## Technologies Used
The program is built using:
- **Data Structures (Queues)**: Implements the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: For effective code organization and maintainability.
- **`std::queue` from the Standard Template Library (STL)**: To manage queue operations.
- **`clsDate` Library**: To handle date and time functionalities.
